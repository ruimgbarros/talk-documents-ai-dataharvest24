"On MAY 31 • FRIDAY at 1:15pm – 1:15pm we will have the talk 'How to verify leak data - A checklist approach' with the speakers Speakers: Ben Heubl. The description of the talk is: As a modern journalist or researcher, you may get your hands on leaked data or documents, possibly from a
person or a company that might reveal a crime or dodgy schemes. Süddeutsche Zeitung opened a new era a
few years ago when it worked on The Panama Papers. Since then, we learned a lot. Ben Heubl, an investigative
journalist at SZ will share with you his insights on how journalists can be sure it's the real deal? A leaked data
verification checklist for investigators",

"On MAY 31 • FRIDAY at 1:15pm – 2:30pm we will have the talk 'Exploring AI: Investigating datasets to better understand AI' with the speakers Speakers: Christo Buschek. The description of the talk is: LAION-5B is a dataset with 5.8 billion image and text pairs—too large to make sense of. It is an open-source
foundation dataset that trains AI models such as Stable Diffusion. In collaboration with the Knowing Machines
Project at New York University, Der SPIEGEL and Paper Trail Media investigated this dataset, which is meant to
give machines a comprehensive representation of the world to build a vocabulary of things and concepts.
In this talk, Christo Buschek traces the construction of the dataset to better understand its contents, implications,
and entanglements. He will show the curatorial mechanisms chosen to construct the dataset and how those
mechanisms propagate biases of other machine learning models and datasets and structural biases of the AI
field itself.
Investments in AI systems are in the trillions, and those systems are deployed at a neck-break speed. To be able
to investigate the datasets behind them is an essential tool for journalists to holistically interrogate AI systems—
the data, the models, and the emerging effects of AI.",
"On MAY 31 • FRIDAY at 1:15pm – 2:30pm we will have the talk 'Media freedom at risk: Can the EU protect us?' with the speakers Speakers: Staffan Dahllöf, Harald Schumann, Lucie Sykorova, Maciej Styczen. The description of the talk is: In many EU countries the freedom of the media is under threat. Governments turn public TV, radio and news
agencies into their propaganda instruments. Investors buy media companies in order to spread the narratives of
the extreme right. Security authorities abuse their power to spy on journalists and reveal their sources.
To counter this threat, the EU commission has launched the European Media Freedom Act (EMFA), which has
recently been adopted after a long power struggle in the Council and the European Parliament.
But does the law actually give us the instruments needed to defend media freedom against the growing threat?
Can it be used to stop the assaults of the Italian, Greek or Slovakian governments against the plurality in the
public media?
Does it limit the right of investors to force the media workers to promote the ideology of the owner?
Does it actually protect us and our sources against the surveillance of the security agencies?
Are there risks with a EU-wide media law bypassing or superseding national legislation?",
"On MAY 31 • FRIDAY at 1:15pm – 2:30pm we will have the talk 'Who funds Europe's political parties? We have the data' with the speakers Speakers: Jesse Pinster, Adriana Homolova. The description of the talk is: Who is funding political parties? What influence do they get in return? Follow the Money has built the first-ever
database - along with a user-friendly dashboard - containing all the available data on donations to the political
parties of the EU-27 from 2019-23. The database also includes other sources of income for political parties
(mainly state aid), allowing comparison of the ratio between public and private funding across countries. We
hope this new database will give you an unique insight into political funders and their intent. A group of
investigative journalists is now diving into the data. Join us for the session, and find out how you can also find
stories in the data!",
"On MAY 31 • FRIDAY at 1:15pm – 2:30pm we will have the talk 'Ah Mapbox, here we go again! How to make Mapbox work with large datasets' with the speakers Speakers: Ana Ruiz, Krisztián Szabó. The description of the talk is: If you have ever seen a huge Mapbox map but don't know how it was made, this session will solve the mystery.
You will learn how to upload big files to Mapbox, by optimizing the files, using geoJSONs and avoiding uploading
files through Mapbox Studio.
We will be using the command line to convert geospatial files to geoJSON, dropping and changing all those little
bits of data that make vectors heavier and heavier. We will use a couple of Mapbox own libraries (also in the
command line) to add the final details and to upload the information to their servers.
After attending this session, participants will be able to understand how Mapbox works and how to upload bigger
files to it. Previous experience with Mapbox is recommended. You should be comfortable using the command
line. If you are bringing your own computer you will need to install WSL or similar with an Ubuntu distribution. You
will also need the commandline tools Mapshaper, geojson-precision and mapboxcli installed.
Please set up a (free) Mapbox account before the session. (https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/)",
"On MAY 31 • FRIDAY at 1:15pm – 2:30pm we will have the talk 'Extract all relations in Game of Thrones using AI and Python' with the speakers Speakers: Misha Gagrin, Lasse Edfast. The description of the talk is: AI-models are great tools to make unstructured data structured, and especially so if you know some basic
Python. Those language models can be used to find and classify all arguments in a bunch of documents, make
statistics of political debates or hunt for greenwashing in corporate reports. In this session we will extract all
relations in the Game of Thrones series and plot it as a network map. Come along if you want to know who slept
with whom! (Here is an example of how it can look like: https://lasseedfast.se/got/ ). After following the session,
you will learn how to use AI in combination with Python to systematically extract pieces of information from a
large amount of data.
To follow along, participants need a basic understanding of Python.
Install Ollama (ollama.com) and download one of the models if you want to follow along on your own laptop.",
"On MAY 31 • FRIDAY at 1:15pm – 2:30pm we will have the talk 'How to fundraise - seen from the funder's chair' with the speakers Moderators: Peter Matjašič
Speakers: Ebru Akgun, Anna Groenewegen, Eszter Szucs. The description of the talk is: Many independent public interest media outlets have to fundraise and navigate the waters of funders and
donors. Fundraising is time-consuming and nerve-wrecking, for both start-ups and more established outlets: How
do you approach a new funder? Should you try to build up a relationship before applying for funds? Is it okay to
send all the funders the same report, even if they have different reporting standards? Will the funders try to
influence our journalism?
In this session you can meet three different kind of funders in the media sector, and they will answer all your
questions, seen from the funder’s chair. You can voice your questions – and you can also ask the moderator to
do it for you",
"On MAY 31 • FRIDAY at 1:15pm – 2:30pm we will have the talk 'Investigating the past - lessons from the Nazi era' with the speakers Speakers: Astrid Viciano. The description of the talk is: We all understand that the way history is being told depends on who takes the lead in recounting the events. As
investigative journalists, we usually research topics from the present or recent past: but what if we used our
investigative skills to research historical topics? How can we know what really happened? In this session, you
will learn how to investigate people and events from the past. Astrid Viciano will share her experience of
researching the era of national socialism, and the race for the first nuclear weapon in Europe. She will explain
how best to interview witnesses several decades after the events; how to find original archive material; and how
to identify dubious sources. Join her for a hands-on session on how to bring history to life, in all its shades and
nuances",
"On MAY 31 • FRIDAY at 1:15pm – 2:30pm we will have the talk 'How to find people with minimal clues' with the speakers Speakers: Karina Shedrofsky. The description of the talk is: Tracking down elusive individuals is the bread and butter of OSINT work, but what can you do when armed only
with a single photo or username? In this session, we’ll walk you through examples of how we cracked some of
the most difficult cases (eg, tracking down an Iranian fugitive in the U.S. or the father of a posh Ukrainian living in
Italy). We will unveil the power of combining image recognition, social media sleuthing, advanced Google
searches, and exploring leaked data. You will discover some new techniques, and creative ways of thinking to
raise your investigative game.",
